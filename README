USE CASES:
    *spend a day at the theater = movie "agnostic"
    	   SCORE / LOCATION
    *i want to see a particular movie, can I sneak into another one since I'm here
       	    MOVIE / TIME

		   to start all over
	pros
		choice clarity

	HIPMUNK
	cons
		information overload
		too redundant
	pro
		quick to scroll through relative times

		    
	BLEND?

	inputs:
		location (done)

		time range
		movie
